In 1996, the need was identified for a local Newcastle company in the engineering plastic field that would provide in-house, high quality service at a competitive price to suit all industries.

Trident Plastic – a proud, local, family owned Australian company – was established to fulfil this requirement.

Trident grew quickly to be one of NSW leading suppliers of engineering and industrial plastics, plastic machining and plastic fabricated products, including in-house casting and machining of polyurethane products.

The demand for proper and uniformed welding procedures, especially in tank manufacturing, continues to increase. In recognition of this, Trident staff are internationally accredited DVS certified in plastic welding, complimented by state of the art machinery.

Trident has a commitment to developing close and sustainable relationships with customers through quality materials and products and a continuing high level of service.
